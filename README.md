# Palmoria-Group-Emp-Analysis

This project is in fulfillment of my capstone project at OUI Bootcamp. I assumed the role of an HR analyst working with employees data to identify key areas within the business that embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality.

Data Source:
The database was gotten from Oui bootcamp and it contains two tables ‘Emp data’ and ‘bonus rules’. When merged together, they contain 1000 records and 12 attributes. The dataset contains information of employees, information such as name, department, gender, salary, location, rating, gender, percentage, bonus, payout. Other additional information about employees ratings and bonus are in the ‘bonus rules’ table.
